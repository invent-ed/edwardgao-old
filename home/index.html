            <img src="./images/geemail.png" alt="geemail">
            <p>Senior year of high school, I was taking all my classes at the local community college through Jump Start. So I decided to also go to a coding bootcamp called DevLeague to keep myself busy. This website was the challenge that all applicants to the bootcamp had to pass to get in. DevLeague would provide a javascript file that outputs random email messages, while applicants have to make a website that displays the data and figure out how to upload the code to GitHub.</p>

            <p>Junior year of high school was eventful. I started our school's robotics club and participated in the FIRST Tech Challenge. Meanwhile, I also had to take courses at the local community college through Running Start, practice for our school's It's Academic Hawaii team, practice for our school's first Cyberpatriot team, AND do Judo (oh the horrors). </p>

            <p>This website was created for the plants and animals of Hawaii project for biology class. Codecademy started around this time (2013), which was where I learned how to use jQuery to do the animations</p>

            <p>This video was created for a research project on malaria for global studies class. Shout out to Kurzgesagt who started their YouTube channel around this time (2013), which is why a lot of the animation was inspired by their style.</p>

            <h2>Save Crazy Dave!</h2>
            <img src="./images/crazy-dave.png" alt="crazy-dave">
            <p>This was one of my oldest projects, it was a game I made for programming class. The assignment only required the use of mouse events, but since I had already been playing with Flash for a while, I decided to make something a little more complicated... This game was created using Macromedia Flash 8 and ActionScript 2. The game has Chinese written all over it because I was attending school in Macau at the time (2012). If you are brave enough, open <a class="link" href="./other/crazy-dave.swf" >this link</a> to download the ancient .swf file.</p>

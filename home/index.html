            <p class="span">after (a faster and easier way to search for classes)</p>
            <p>Searching for classes on my school's website is a pain, I could only search 3 classes at a time, and click through numerous drop down menus. I thought, why couldn't I just search for classes like a Google search entry? So I created a website that improved on the current website by allowing for fuzzy search, and a more organized (and readable) candidate class list. How did I get the course information without access to the school's database? I hacked it, hence the HackSU hackathon. Just kidding, I had to painstakingly scrape through all the classes for Winter Quarter 2018 by learning how to use PhantomJS and CasperJS. That was also how I implemented a login function with our school's actual authentication system - by simulating a login on the school website on the backend. The frontend was built using React and Redux for state management.</p>

            <img src="./images/architekt.png" alt="architekt">
            <p>This was one of the bigger projects during my time at DevLeague. We just learned about Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and now it all comes together in this web app that uses all of it. We used Handlebars for front-end templating, and implemented RESTful APIs on the backend. The design of the site was <strike>stolen from</strike> an imitation of Wordpress' Architekt Theme.</p>

            <img src="./images/waave.png" alt="waave">
            <p>The theme for Global Game Jam 2017 was "waves", so our team created a game called Adware WAAVEs (Why Are Ads Virtually Everywhere). The idea was that <i>waves</i> of ads will bombard the player, and the player will have to <i>curl</i> it away using a terminal. I really wanted to create a terminal emulator, so I pushed the idea of using a terminal as the interface, which was a terrible idea because to be honest the terminal made the game look super boring. Oh well...</p>

            <p>Populating a webpage with thousands of div's may not be the most efficient way to make a MS Paint rip-off, but it did teach me a lot about the Document Object Model (DOM). I also learned about local storage on the browser by implementing a save functionality.</p>

            <p>Senior year of high school, I was taking all my classes at the local community college through Jump Start. So I decided to also go to a coding bootcamp called DevLeague to keep myself busy. This website was the challenge that all applicants to the bootcamp had to pass to get in. DevLeague would provide a javascript file that outputs random email messages, while applicants have to make a website that displays the data and figure out how to upload the code to GitHub.</p>

            <p>This was one of my oldest projects, it was a game I made for programming class. The assignment only required the use of mouse events, but since I had already been playing with Flash for a while, I decided to make something a little more complicated... This game was created using Macromedia Flash 8 and ActionScript 2. The game has Chinese written all over it because I was attending school in Macau at the time (2012).
